        <h1>Hello. My name is Patrick Minero.</h1>
        <p>I am a coffee connoisseur, craft beer and funky wine lover. I help people, fix and improve things, solve problems, learn new things and keep growing as a professional and a person.</p>
        <p>I was born and raised in San Salvador, El Salvador. Despite the bad comments you have heard growing up in El Salvador in the 90â€™s was not such a bad thing. My childhood was very similar to most, watching MTV, listening Alt-Rock and what not. Probably the biggest difference was the language, eating pupusas and playing soccer in the street almost everyday.</p>
        <p>Few years go by, I graduated high school and enroll in a university to be a lawyer. This is when my journey began. Violence in San Salvador lead me to fled my home, leave my family and friends and look for new beginnings.</p>

        <p>I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2008, more specifically to Marin County, 10 minutes north of San Francisco. Adjusting was not really difficult for me, I learned to speak English in elementary school, that made it easy to find good job opportunities and have a great time.</p>
        <p>Time flew by, 11 years later, my wife and I felt the need for a change. We saved money, worked overtime and by april 2018 we got rid of all our belongings and embarked on a trip without a set route, time frame or final destination. One thing we knew was that we were not going back to California.</p>
